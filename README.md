# WGU_D277-Front-End-Web-Development
First coding Project and Class For WGU. 

## Task 1
Scenario
You are at a job interview for an entry-level position on the web development team at a state government office. After inquiring about your education, skills, and experience, the hiring manager asks you to design some low-level comprehensive page layouts as part of the interview process.

The website will feature information about one U.S. state and three cities within that state. The first layout will serve as the template for the site's home page. This page will include some introductory information about the state, some images, and links to three interior pages. The second layout will serve as the model for the interior pages of the site. Each of these interior pages will feature one city within the chosen state. Each of these three pages will also include information about the city, such as demographics, population, average salary, cost of living, and weather, as well as images.
Assumptions
Before you begin, consider the following:

•   This task does not involve coding with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Instead, you will create images of two low-level comprehensive page layouts and submit them for evaluation. You can use any graphics creation or manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or other appropriate tool of your choice to create the images.

•   After submitting this task, you may contact your assigned instructor for guidance on how to make any needed revisions. You should aim to pass your task within three attempts.


Note: This task must be completed, submitted, and evaluated as a "Pass" before you can submit Task 2. You should not begin working on Task 2 until this task has been evaluated as a "Pass."

Requirements
Your submission must represent your original work and understanding of the course material. Most performance assessment submissions are automatically scanned through the WGU similarity checker. Students are strongly encouraged to wait for the similarity report to generate after uploading their work and then review it to ensure Academic Authenticity guidelines are met before submitting the file for evaluation. See Understanding Similarity Reports for more information.

Grammarly Note:
Professional Communication will be automatically assessed through Grammarly for Education in most performance assessments before a student submits work for evaluation. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Grammarly for Education feedback prior to submitting work for evaluation, as the overall submission will not pass without this aspect passing. See Use Grammarly for Education Effectively for more information.

Microsoft Files Note:
Write your paper in Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) unless another Microsoft product, or pdf, is specified in the task directions. Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc.  All supporting documentation, such as screenshots and proof of experience, should be collected in a pdf file and submitted separately from the main file. For more information, please see Computer System and Technology Requirements.



You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.



A.  Use your chosen graphics software to create one image of each of the following low-level comprehensive layouts (a total of two images):

1.  Create Layout #1, a home page including clearly denoted placeholders for each of the following semantic elements:

•   a header element

•   a nav  element

•   a section element

•   an aside element



Note: This layout will be used in Task 2 to create the main entry point into the website.



2.  Create Layout #2, an interior page including clearly denoted placeholders for each of the following semantic elements:

•   a header element

•   a nav  element

•   a section element

•   an aside element



Note: This layout will be used in Task 2 to create all other pages of the website that are not the home page.



Note: Save the two images to a location on your computer that you can easily access later.


B.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.


Note: Professional communication is not assessed until all other aspects are complete.
