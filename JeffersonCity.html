                Jefferson City was designated as the state capital of Missouri in 1821, following Missouri's admission to the Union.
                The state legislature and General Assembly moved to Jefferson City in 1825.
                During the Civil War, the Union drove out the elected officials who were considered traitors.
                After the Civil War, the government returned to Jefferson City and remains there today.
